### Hey! ðŸŒ± 

I'm a trans gal living in Victoria, BC doing game development, art, and writing. I love rich, emotionally-motivated storytelling and exploring new applications for interactive multimedia.

I've worked on <a href="">Keeper of the Labyrinth</a>, a text-based narrative game built in my own Typescript/Electron based game engine for hypertext literature. Alongside dev tools to support that project, I've uilt a few other projects that you can see here.

Language and Framework Proficiencies: 
    HTML/CSS/JS, Typescript, Electron, and Svelte. Python. C# for Unity Scripting.
    
Software Proficiencies: 
    10+ years using Clip Studio Paint for illustration, 2D animation, and UI design with vector tools.
    Experience with Unity and Blender.

Besides programming, I'm also an artist and writer. My short stories, essays, and artwork are available to see on my <a href="https://nymphofthevales.com">personal website</a>.

If you wanna get in touch about anything at all, feel free to shoot me an email at nymphofthevales@gmail.com!
