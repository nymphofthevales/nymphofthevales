### Hey! ðŸŒ± 

I'm a trans gal from Calgary, Alberta (she/her). I'm currently studying computer science + math at the University of Victoria. 

I'm really passionate about game development, and am currently working on <a href="">Keeper of the Labyrinth</a>, a text-based narrative game which I'll publish on Steam as soon as it's done(!!). After that, I've got plans for a few other games/branching path stories/weird interactive experiences that I'm hoping to put together in the next couple years.

I mostly work in Typescript/Javascript, but am also proficient in Python, and I'm always looking for new things to add to my repertoire! I'm hoping to get into Unity next...

Besides programming, I'm also an artist and writer. Some of my short stories, essays, and artwork are available to see on my <a href="https://nymphofthevales.com">personal website</a>.

If you wanna get in touch about anything at all, feel free to shoot me an email at nymphofthevales@gmail.com!
